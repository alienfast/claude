# PR Title and Description Generator

Generate or update a PR title and description based on the actual changes in the current branch.

## Core Principle

**Document ONLY what exists in the final state of the code, not the development history.**

If a feature was added in one commit and removed in another, it should NOT be in the PR description. Always verify features exist in `HEAD` before documenting them.

## Analysis Process

### 1. Identify Current Branch and PR

```bash
git branch --show-current
gh pr view --json number,title,url
```

### 2. Analyze Final State Changes

```bash
# Get commit count
git log main..HEAD --oneline | wc -l

# Get file change summary
git diff main...HEAD --stat

# Identify major areas of change
git diff main...HEAD --name-only | cut -d/ -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

### 3. Verify What's Actually in the Code

**CRITICAL**: For each area of apparent change, verify if it's in the final state:

```bash
# Check if a feature is in final code
git show HEAD:path/to/file.ts | grep -q "feature_name" && echo "PRESENT" || echo "REMOVED"

# Example: Check for authentication plugin
git show HEAD:cloud/database/src/SqlDatabase.ts | grep "authentication_plugin"

# Example: Check if a function exists
git show HEAD:src/utils.ts | grep -A10 "function myFunction"
```

**If a feature doesn't appear in the final state, DO NOT include it in the PR description.**

### 4. Categorize Changes by Impact

Organize changes into categories based on what's actually present:

- **Infrastructure Changes**: Cloud resources, deployments, architecture
- **Developer Experience**: Tooling, documentation, local development setup
- **CI/CD**: Pipeline changes, automation workflows
- **Breaking Changes**: API changes, configuration requirements, migration needs
- **Dependencies**: Package updates that remain in final package.json/lock files
- **Documentation**: New or updated docs (verify files exist)

### 5. Document Only Present Changes

For each change area:

1. **Verify existence**: Run `git show HEAD:path/to/file` to confirm
2. **Link to files**: Use markdown links with relative paths from repo root
   - Files: `[filename.ts](path/to/filename.ts)`
   - Specific lines: `[filename.ts:42](path/to/filename.ts#L42)`
   - Line ranges: `[filename.ts:42-51](path/to/filename.ts#L42-L51)`
3. **Include code snippets**: For configuration changes, show actual values
4. **Provide context**: Explain why the change was made, not just what changed

## Quality Verification Checklist

Before finalizing the description, verify:

- [ ] Every feature mentioned exists in `git show HEAD:path/to/file`
- [ ] No references to features that were added then removed during development
- [ ] All file links use relative paths from repo root (not absolute paths)
- [ ] Configuration examples reflect actual current state in HEAD
- [ ] Breaking changes are clearly marked with "Breaking Changes" section
- [ ] Testing sections describe actual tests that currently pass
- [ ] Code snippets are from actual files in HEAD, not from memory

## PR Title Formats

See [resources/title-patterns.md](resources/title-patterns.md) for comprehensive title format examples and patterns.

Quick reference:

- Infrastructure: "Enterprise [resource] with [key feature] and [secondary feature]"
- Features: "Add [feature] with [benefit]"
- Bug Fixes: "Fix [specific issue] in [area]"
- Refactoring: "Refactor [area] to [improvement]"

Avoid vague titles like "PR deployment", "Various fixes", or "Update code".

## Description Structure

For detailed templates, see:

- [templates/feature.md](templates/feature.md) - Feature additions
- [templates/bugfix.md](templates/bugfix.md) - Bug fixes
- [templates/infrastructure.md](templates/infrastructure.md) - Infrastructure changes

Use this general template structure:

```markdown
## Summary

[1-2 sentence overview of what this PR accomplishes and why]

## [Major Category 1 - e.g., Infrastructure Changes]

### [Subcategory - e.g., Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus]

**[Feature Name]:**
- [Implementation detail verified in HEAD]
- [Configuration detail with actual values]
- [Benefit or impact]

**Implementation:**
- File: [link to main file](path/to/file.ts)
- Configuration: [link to config](path/to/config.yaml)

**Stack Commands:**
- `./stack command_name` - Description

**Documentation:**
- [Link to relevant docs](doc/path/to/doc.md)

[Repeat structure for each major category]

## Breaking Changes

### [Area Affected]
- **What changed**: [Specific change]
- **Migration**: [Steps to migrate]
- **Impact**: [Who/what is affected]

## Dependencies

- Updated `package-name` to version X.Y.Z
- Added `new-package` for [specific purpose]
- Removed `old-package` (no longer needed)

## Testing

**[Test Category]:**
- ‚úÖ [Specific test that validates the change]
- ‚úÖ [Another specific test]
- ‚úÖ [Integration test description]

**[Another Test Category]:**
- ‚úÖ [Test description]

## Cost Impact

[If applicable - infrastructure cost changes]

**Production:**
- Current: $X/month
- Planned: $Y/month (with optimization Z)
- Benefit: [SLA/performance/reliability improvements]

**[Environment]:**
- Base: $X/month (shared infrastructure)
- Per-[unit]: +$Y/month

## Verification Workflow

For step-by-step examples of how to analyze and verify PR changes, see [resources/analysis-workflow.md](resources/analysis-workflow.md).

You can also use the verification script:

```bash
# Check if a feature exists in final state
./scripts/verify-feature.sh path/to/file.ts "feature_name"

# Check if a file exists
./scripts/verify-feature.sh packages/api/README.md ""
```

## Important Rules

1. **Verify before documenting** - Always use `git show HEAD:file` to confirm features exist in final state
2. **Never mention removed features** - If a commit added something but it was later removed or reverted, don't include it
3. **Focus on outcomes, not process** - Describe the result, not the development journey
4. **Link to actual code** - Every major feature should have a file reference that users can click
5. **Be specific** - "Add MySQL native password authentication" not "Update database config"
6. **Test your claims** - If you say "CI runs connectivity checks", verify the CI file actually shows that
7. **Use present tense** - "Adds X", "Implements Y", not "Added X", "Implemented Y"
8. **Quantify when possible** - "3x performance improvement", "99.99% SLA", "$460/month cost"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Documenting Removed Features

```
# Commit history shows:
# - Commit A: Add feature X
# - Commit B: Remove feature X
# Final state: No feature X

# WRONG: "Added feature X"
# RIGHT: Don't mention feature X at all
```

### ‚ùå Vague Descriptions

```
# WRONG: "Updated database configuration"
# RIGHT: "Set default_authentication_plugin to mysql_native_password for Cloud SQL Proxy v2 compatibility"
```

### ‚ùå Missing Verification

```
# WRONG: Assume a feature exists because you saw it in commit messages
# RIGHT: git show HEAD:path/to/file.ts | grep "feature_name"
```

### ‚ùå Broken Links

```
# WRONG: [config.ts](/Users/kross/project/src/config.ts)
# RIGHT: [config.ts](src/config.ts)
```

## After Generating Description

Update the PR using GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh pr edit <number> --title "Your Title Here" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
[Your full description here]
EOF
)"
```

Confirm the update was successful:

```bash
gh pr view <number>
```
