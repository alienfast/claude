## update tooling

```sh
/plan-execution use the ../js project as inspiration:  
 - Remove eslint and prettier from this project, replace with biome and markdownlint
 - Update the .vscode settings changes  
 - Remove the typescript project references and implement the similar check-types.  
 - Add the check-circular, and change the script names here to be consistent with the ones from the ../js project.  
 - Update all script names with ':" in them, e.g. clean:yarn -> clean-yarn
 - Verify in the end after all is done with a call to yarn check, which should be like the one in ../js.  
 - Once complete, update the CLAUDE.md with any changes.
```
